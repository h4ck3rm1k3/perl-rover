<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Installation</A></H2>

<P>
<!-- title paragraph here -->
Rover installs like any other perl module.  However, it is not avilable through
CPAN, so it must be installed manually.  Follow these steps in order to get Rover
working on your system.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Dependencies</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
There is only one hard dependency for Rover, and that is
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl">Expect for perl</A>.  The
easiest way to get this installed (if you do not already have it), is to let
The Rover installation script install it for you.<BR><BR>

If you already have Expect, then you should be able to install at least the
Rover core package and the command line interface.  Rover is 100% Perl, and
requires no C compiler to install.<BR><BR>

If, however, you would like to run the graphical user interface, you need to also have the
<A HREF="http://search.cpan.org/~mlehmann/Gtk-Perl-0.7009/Gtk/objects.pod">Gtk perl</A>
module.  Again, the easiest way to get this is to let the Rover installation
script install it for you.<BR><BR>

<B><FONT COLOR=RED>Note</FONT></B>: If you chose to let the installer build Gtk-Perl,
you must have the gtk+ development packages installed.  Please refer to your OS
documentation for details on installing these.<BR><BR>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 Download</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
In order to download the latest copy of Rover, use the
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=118999">download section</A>
of the SourceForge project page.<BR><BR>

The file should be a gziped tar file named Rover-2.xx.tar.gz.  The xx denotes the latest
version.



<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 Build and Install</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
After downloading Rover, extract the contents using the following syntax:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    $ gunzip -c Rover-2.xx.tar.gz | tar xvf -
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

After it is extracted, cd into the Rover-2.xx directory and install it as a normal Perl module.
The steps for this are:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    $ perl Makefile.PL<BR>
    $ make<BR>
    $ su<BR>
    # make install<BR>
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Alternatively you can chose to have the installation script build and install the dependancies
for you.  The install script will use CPAN to install missing perl modules.  If you have not
used CPAN before, you will be prompted to configure it.  Here is the syntax for using this
option:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    $ perl Makefile.PL --install-deps
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you chose not to install the graphical interface, but still wish to use the command line, use
this command instead:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    $ perl Makefile.PL --no-gtk
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The above two examples will require an additional "make" and "make install".<BR><BR>
