<H2><A NAME="s2">2. The Hosts List</A></H2>

<P>
<!-- title paragraph here -->
This section will describe how to specify remote machines within Rover,
how to store custom information about them, and how to select them for
processing a Rover run.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 What is the Hosts List</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
Simply stated, a hosts list is a list of hostnames or IP addresses of remote
machines.  It is the list that Rover uses to determine which machines to connect
to in order to process a run.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Creating the Hosts List</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
The default location for the hosts list is the file $HOME/.rover/hosts.txt.  Populating
this file is the first thing that should be done prior to running Rover.  The easiest way
to do this is to create the file by hand with your favorite editor.<BR><BR>

The format for the file is one hostname/IP address per line.  A simple example is as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    atlantis<BR>
    valhalla<BR>
    hades<BR>
    eldorado<BR>
    shangri-la<BR>
    olympus<BR>
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This list has six(6) hosts defined: atlantis, valahalla, hades, eldorado, shangri-la, and olympus.
The hostnames were used in this example, it is expected that each name will resolve to some IP address.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Storing Custom Fields</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
In many cases (especially within the GUI), it is helpful to store more information about a
machine then the hostname/IP.  Rover allows for custom fields to be appended after the hostname
using a comma seperated format.  The syntax is as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    &lt;HOSTNAME&gt;[,field 1[,...]]
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This will store the information in field 1, and any subsequent fields, in a global array that is
available for reference to custom modules.  Primarily, this is usefull within the GUI, as you 
will then be able to sort on these fields.  Here is an example:<BR><BR>

<CENTER>
  <IMG SRC="images/screen1.jpg">
</CENTER><BR>

In this example, our hosts list is as follows:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <CODE>
    atlantis,Desktop,Workstation,Ubuntu<BR>
    eldorado,Production,Server,Slackware<BR>
    hades,Production,Server,Slackware<BR>
    olympus,Production,Server,Slackware<BR>
    shangri-la,Production,Server,Slackware<BR>
    valhalla,Development,Server,Slackware<BR>
  </CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Selecting Hosts</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
By default, Rover uses all machines within the hosts list.  From the command line there are two options
for selecting a subset of machines.  The first is to use an alternative hosts file with the "--hosts-file"
command line switch.  The second is to pick them interactively with the "-p|--pick" command line option.
See "man rover" for more details.<BR><BR>

From the GUI, no hosts are selected by default.  You can select them by left clicking on the appropriate
row with your mouse.  Use the Ctrl and Shift keys to select multiple hosts.
