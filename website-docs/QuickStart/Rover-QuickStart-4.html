<P>
<!-- title paragraph here -->
This section takes a step beyond configuration and shows how to execute rulesets
on the remote machines.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Using the Command Line</A>
</H2>

<P>
<!-- sub title paragraph here -->
The command line can be ran interactively or in batch mode.  Running interactively,
you will be able to enter password information, select hosts, and modify the
current configuration.  By default rover will execute in interactive mode, prompting
you for your password(s).  Other switches that force interactive modes are:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><B>-s or --shell</B>: Enter built-in shell</LI>
    <LI><B>-p or --pick</B>: Interactively pick hosts</LI>
  </UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

When entering password information from the command line, you can enter as many
passwords as you like.  Press enter, leaving the entry blank, in order to finish
entering passwords.<BR><BR>

In order to avoid being prompted, and run in batch mode, you
must not use any of the above switches and also specify the following:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <UL>
    <LI><B>--no-auth</B>: Do not prompt for authentication</LI>
  </UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Here is an example of running rover in batch mode.  This example selects the Ruleset
Unix_Uptime, specifies there be no password prompting, no banner, and use verbose output:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <PRE>
$ rover -r Unix_Uptime --no-auth --no-banner -v
atlantis:       Begining execution
valhalla:       Begining execution
hades:          Begining execution
eldorado:       Begining execution
valhalla:       running execute(uptime...)
hades:          running execute(uptime...)
atlantis:       running execute(uptime...)
eldorado:       running execute(uptime...)
atlantis:       Done
valhalla:       Done
hades:          Done
shangri-la:     Begining execution
eldorado:       Done
olympus:        Begining execution
shangri-la:     running execute(uptime...)
olympus:        running execute(uptime...)
shangri-la:     Done
olympus:        Done

No login failures recorded!

Finished. Elapsed time: 5 seconds.

When using the graphical interface, you will have to enter your password information manually.
To do this, from the main window select File, then Set Password.  You will be able to enter
passwords for your username, or root, in case you specified logging in as root.<BR><BR>

Type in passwords in the text boxes, and click the Add button to included them.  A running count
of how many passwords you have entered is displayed for both users.  Below is a screenshot
of the password window:<BR><BR>

When your ready to run Rover, select File from the main menu, then Run Rover.  The following
window will then be displayed:<BR><BR>

From this window, you can control whether or not the commands need to be ran as root.
You can also override the configured rulesets by using the "Quick Command" feature.
See <A HREF="Rover-QuickStart-5.html">Using Rover Effectively</A> for more details.<BR><BR>

When your ready to run, click the "Run" button.  A progress bar and cancel button will
appear durring the run.  Afterwards, each machine that ran will appear in either the
Success or Failure window.  You can view the status of each machine by clicking on
the name within the Success or Failure window.  A new window will appear with information
about the run:<BR><BR>

In the above example, the host "atlantis" was selected.  We can see that the command 
"execute(uptime)" was ran successfully.  We also have the option of viewing the log
file for this run.
