ROVER 3.0
=========

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Rover is designed to provide a means of executing commands on remote
systems.  The Rover perl module manages connections to remote servers
and supplies an Expect object to other functions provided by extension
modules.  One of the key advantages of Rover is that it runs many
hosts in parallel, and keeps track of individual failures.

Rover comes with a core module that contains standard functions
execute, send, get_file, and put_file.  Additional modules may
be found on the home page: http://rover.sourceforge.net

Rover comes with two frontend programs, rover and rovergtk.  The first,
rover, is ran either interactively or in batch mode from the command
line.  Rovergtk uses the Gtk2 perl module for a graphical X user
interface.

Rover, and its accompanying extension modules, are 100% perl and do
not require a C compiler to install.  However, depending on what
pre-requisites are installed, you may need to compile a few other
modules before installing Rover.


INSTALLATION
------------
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

There are several options you can supply to "perl Makefile.PL":

   --no-gtk            Do not install rovergtk, or check for Gtk
                       perl module.
   --no-deps           Do not check for dependencies, just install.
   --install-deps      Attempt to install dependencies via CPAN.

By default, "perl Makefile.PL" will check for dependencies and
exit if any are missing.  Using --install-deps will attempt to
install them using CPAN.  If CPAN has not been configured, you
may be prompted to do so.

DEPENDANCIES
------------
If you want to run rover you must have these perl modules:

   IO::Pty
   IO::Tty
   IO::Stty
   Expect

Also, new to version 3.0, threads are now required.  If your
version of perl was not configured to use ithreads, you will not
be able to use this version of Rover.
