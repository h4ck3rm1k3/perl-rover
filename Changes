Entire rewrite, Rover now can be called in an OO fasion.  Also, perl ithreads
are used for parallel processing.  No IPC objects are used anymore.  Gtk2 now
used instead of gtk.

* This version changes the way children processes communicate to the watcher.
Previously a named pipe was used ($Rover::ipc_fifo), now System V IPC
message queues are used ($Rover::ipc_msg).  This eliminates the need to do
file locking within Rover, and improves client/watcher communications as
we can see how many messages are in the queue.
